An idea comes from: https://github.com/tpurtell/PWM<br>
This one though is a command-line utility, which allows you changing frequency on Windows startup

# WHAT'S THIS?
This utility allows you to adjust the LCD panel backlight PWM driver frequency, controlled by Intel Graphics embedded GPU

# WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
Changing the value from the default one may affect the lifetime of the lamp in your screen.  You might end up looking into the abyss. You have been WARNED!
